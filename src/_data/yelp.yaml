    text: Ramiro is a nice gentlemen who provides quality work at a cost that won't kill you like the dealerships. I'm an Uber driver and two of my friends recommended him. He has a comfortable waiting room with all the amenities. He put out an area heater on a very chilly morning for another customer and I when he saw us shivering in the waiting area! I highly recommend him!

    text: I have been going to get my car issues fixed by Ramiro and his guys for over a year now (brakes, oil changes, body damage, and most recently a cracked windshield). They are always efficient, trustworthy, reliable, and helpful. I highly recommend them.
